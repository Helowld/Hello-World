-- HasKell Programming Language

{- 
    The Haskell system evaluated the string, and print directly to standard output:
   `main` refers to the entry point.
   `putStrLn` is a built-in function. 
-}

-- This first line is a type signature, declaring the type of `main`. 
-- Values of type IO() describe actions which can interact with the outside world.
main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello, World!"
