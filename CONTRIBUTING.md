Contributing to Hello-World
=======================

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be reviewd.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Helowld/Hello-World/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report, and I think it's not a bad model. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408), an app developer.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [My stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that *anyone* with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.


## Guidelines for Merging

- while giving the Pull requests please follow the template [PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](./PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
- fileName should be hello_world.extension like **hello_world.c**(file name and extension should be in lowercase)
- A language file must contain
     1. Langauge Name
     2. Language's official website and/or popular website which teaches that.
     3. Comments which explains the code properly
     4. Steps to run the program(optional)
- you should consider the reader as newbies, so explain the code neatly.
- the program has to contain the comments which has to explain the program precisely, for example check this out [hello_world.c](https://github.com/rustiever/Hello-World/blob/main/hello_world.c).
- add respective language's official website link and resource material to get started.(For some language official websites or resource materials won't be availabale, in that case add a popular website which has resource material to respective language)
- after adding the new language you should run the updater script in its folder [to know more]()
- PR which will be having the specific file name as given in the issue, the one whose commit descriptions are relevant, and the code is readable, would be merged.
