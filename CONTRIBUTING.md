- fileName should be hello_world.extension like hello_world.c(file name and extension should be in lowercase)
- you should consider the reader as newbies, so explain the code according to that
- the program has to contain the comments which has to explain the program precisely, for example check this out [hello_world.c](https://github.com/rustiever/Hello-World/blob/main/hello_world.c).
- add respective language's official website link and resource material to get started.(For some language official websites or resource materials won't be availabale, in that case add a popular website which has resource material to respective language)
- after adding the new language you should run the updater script in its folder [to know more]()
- PR which will be having the specific file name as given in the issue, the one whose commit descriptions are relevant, and the code is readable, would be merged.
