# Hello World program in R Programming.

# Assigning the value to the variable.
myString <- "Hello, World!"

# Using the built-in function print() to print the contents. The quotes are printed by default. To avoid this we can pass the argument quote = FALSE.
# If there are more than one item, we can use the paste() or cat() function to concatenate the strings together.
print ( myString)
