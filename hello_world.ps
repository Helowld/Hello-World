program HelloWorld;

begin
   writeln('Hello, World!');
   readkey;
end.

(*
The first line of the program program HelloWorld; indicates the name of the program.

The second line of the program uses crt; is a preprocessor command, which tells the compiler to include the crt unit before going to actual compilation.

The next lines enclosed within begin and end statements are the main program block. Every block in Pascal is enclosed within a begin statement and an end statement. However, the end statement indicating the end of the main program is followed by a full stop (.) instead of semicolon (;).

The begin statement of the main program block is where the program execution begins.

The lines within (*...*) will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add a comment in the program.

The statement writeln('Hello, World!'); uses the writeln function available in Pascal which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.

The statement readkey; allows the display to pause until the user presses a key. It is part of the crt unit. A unit is like a library in Pascal.

The last statement end. ends your program.
