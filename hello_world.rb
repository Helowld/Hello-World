# The `puts` is a Ruby method that tells the computer to print some text to the screen.
# The `puts` method is then followed by a sequence of characters â€” `Hello, World!`, enclosed in quotation marks.
# The `puts` method will print this string to the screen when the program runs.
puts "Hello, World!"

# Some methods, like the `puts` method, are included in Ruby by default.
