// Dart is a client-optimized language for fast apps on any platform

// Executes "hello world" in Dart, which is heaviliy used for cross app dev in Flutter
// Flutter is used to develop apps for Android, iOS and the Web, so one framework
// to handle them all.

// Every app has a main() function. To display text on the console,
// you can use the top-level print() function, like here
void main() {
  print('Hello, World!');
}
